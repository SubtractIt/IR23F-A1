The day was grey and bitter cold, and the dogs would not take the scent.
The big black bitch had taken one sniff at the bear tracks, backed off, and skulked back to the pack
with her tail between her legs. The dogs huddled together miserably on the riverbank as the wind
snapped at them. Chett felt it too, biting through his layers of black wool and boiled leather. It was too
bloody cold for man or beast, but here they were. His mouth twisted, and he could almost feel the boils
that covered his cheeks and neck growing red and angry.I should be safe back at the Wall, tending
the bloody ravens and making fires for old Maester Aemon . It was the bastard Jon Snow who had
taken that from him, him and his fat friend Sam Tarly. It was their fault he was here, freezing his bloody
balls off with a pack of hounds deep in the haunted forest.
“Seven hells.” He gave the leashes a hard yank to get the dogs’ attention. “Track, you bastards. That’s
a bear print. You want some meat or no?F Find! ” But the hounds only huddled closer, whining. Chett
snapped his short lash above their heads, and the black bitch snarled at him. “Dog meat would taste as
good as bear,” he warned her, his breath frosting with every word.
Lark the Sisterman stood with his arms crossed over his chest and his hands tucked up into his armpits.
He wore black wool gloves, but he was always complaining how his fingers were frozen. “It’s too bloody
cold to hunt,” he said. “Bugger this bear, he’s not worth freezing over.”
